# Inspiration
With the current pandemic and an unforeseen resolution, communication within the school environment has been heavily impacted. Pre-covid, students would stay updated on school events and clubs through bulletin boards or daily announcements. However, with virtual learning, students are distanced from these updates and often miss online club events. There is no central "hub" where students can be connected with the school despite virtual learning. Each club operates independently using different online tools which makes it hard for students to navigate and stay informed. This lack of information and connection has had a severe impact on students' extracurricular life which in turn affects their mental health. School hub offers a unique solution to this problem.

# What it Does
SchoolHub offers a streamlined platform that acts as a centralized location for all school updates. Users can get access to general school announcements, upcoming school events, and school clubs. Teachers have the authorization to publish school announcements, make events, make clubs and assign club presidents. These club presidents have the authorization to update their respective club announcements and events. General students get access to all this information in an efficient way. Students are also able to easily find contact information for guidance and staff.
